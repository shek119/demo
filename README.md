# demo

This repos is for storing all of my personal project for demonstration and experiment.

1. Coffee Shop  
this project is to create a responsive website using React and React-route.  
The design is also done by myself.  
demo website hosted on codesand box: https://lgwmm.csb.app/  
diffculties: designing a satisfying and neat website  
future improvement: add more interactive animation  
  
  
2. Tetris  
this is a traditional game using canvas  
Aim: practise logic of writing a game. Focus on the javascript part, rather than the design   
How I have done that? Play the game myself and write out the logic and structure. Read code written by different people and write the code  
During testing others code, I even find some bug and able to improve my game  
Difficulties: Figure out how the game should behave and imagin different scenario  


3. Note-taking App  
Build by React and DraftJS with a drag and drop function. Inspired by OneNote  
Difficulties: managing the focus of different textarea(Editor in Draftjs) with any conflict  
Future Improvement: add file saving system   
  
  
4. Note taking app (in development)  
build a note app with creating flash card function  
aim at student and langauge learner, which is me  
build my own backend and api. Has its own database (unlike note-taking app in 3)
